📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and transformation using SQL in MySQL Workbench. The dataset contains information about major tech layoffs, including company names, layoff dates, number of affected employees, industry, and more.

The goal was to clean and prepare the data for further analysis and visualization by ensuring consistency, accuracy, and usability of the dataset.

🔧 Tools Used
MySQL Workbench

SQL (DDL, DML, String Functions, Date Functions)

GitHub for version control and sharing

📌 Key Tasks Performed
Removed duplicate rows using CTEs

Standardized date formats using STR_TO_DATE()

Trimmed and cleaned inconsistent text values (e.g., extra spaces in company names)

Handled null or missing values in key columns

Split or extracted data where necessary (e.g., location fields, percentage formats)

Ensured proper data types for each column (dates, integers, strings)

✅ Outcome
The final cleaned dataset is structured, consistent, and ready for use in downstream analytics — such as creating dashboards in Power BI, Tableau, or performing further statistical analysis in Python or R.
